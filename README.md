## Description
The project is a general knowledge quiz. The
questions are generated in the form of a course, there are 3 courses
composed of 8 questions. 1 course is generated randomly and
the questions are increasingly difficult as you progress. If you do not
answer a question correctly, you start again from the
first question. Once the quiz is passed, the time at which you
completed the quiz is displayed and the player can replay if they wish,
they may come across the same course or another one since
it is chosen randomly.
